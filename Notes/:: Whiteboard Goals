// Whiteboard Goals
Critical Thinking:
1) Formulate Question in your own words:

2) Gather information
 - find related, well practiced question (use tags to further improve connectability of different whiteboard nodes)
 - cross less useful information, filter efficiently and by difficulty

3) Apply Knowledge
 - identify sub-concepts (break into subnodes)
 - find assumptions
 - is everything logically sound

4) Consider implications
 - oppurtunity cost/consequences

5) Explore alternative routes (Very important to further enhance knowledge)
 - record which alternate route nodes you have used/reviewed, store away based on performance/connections/content length.
 - BUT always keep number of review nodes to small manageable size, ie. 5 - 7 or less
